  "overview": "This course equips students with basic knowledge about maps, spatial data, and geographic information systems (GIS), including the basic components of GIS and the principles of GIS. It provides skills in organizing, collecting, integrating, and managing spatial databases from various sources, and methods for processing and analyzing map and geographic information on GIS software. It also provides skills in the diverse use of maps, GIS, and spatial data and their application in resource management decision-making. Students will have the ability to create illustrative maps based on reasonable cartographic principles.",
