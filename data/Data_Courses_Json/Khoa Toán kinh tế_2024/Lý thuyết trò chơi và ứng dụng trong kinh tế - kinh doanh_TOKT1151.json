  "title": "Game Theory and Applications in Economics - Business",
  "overview": "This course presents theoretical knowledge of game theory and skills in applying game theory in economics and business. It introduces strategic games, methods for modeling economic agents' behavior as games, including players, strategies, payoffs, and information. The focus is on finding Nash equilibrium, including pure and mixed strategy equilibria, and their applications in economics, finance, and business.",
