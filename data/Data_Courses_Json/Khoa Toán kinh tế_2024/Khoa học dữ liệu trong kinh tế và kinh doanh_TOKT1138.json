  "title": "Introduction to Data Science in Economics and Business 1",
  "overview": "This course provides fundamental knowledge in the field of data science, serving for data analysis and big data analysis in economics and business. The analysis is aimed at solving specific requirements using data in fields such as banking finance, marketing, commerce - e-commerce, etc. The course consists of two main contents: unsupervised machine learning methods and supervised machine learning methods. The course is taught with an applied orientation, software skills are taught alongside necessary tools, illustrated by practical examples and applications, implemented on the open-source software R.",
