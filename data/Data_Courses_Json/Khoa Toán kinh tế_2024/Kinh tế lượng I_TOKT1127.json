  "title": "Econometrics I",
  "overview": "This course introduces basic knowledge and skills in applied econometric models for analyzing, evaluating the impact of decisions in economics, finance, business, and forecasting. The course focuses on cross-sectional models and a part on time series. Key contents include model formulation, estimation, analysis of linear regression models, model selection and evaluation, statistical inference on regression coefficients and forecasting. In addition to OLS, other advanced estimation methods (GLS, robust estimation, and instrumental variable methods) are introduced. The course uses R/Python software to process and analyze models with real data.",
