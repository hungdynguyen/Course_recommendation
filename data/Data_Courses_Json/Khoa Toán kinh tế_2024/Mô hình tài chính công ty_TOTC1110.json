  "overview": "This course provides concepts about the market value of a company and methods to determine the company's value, known as Market Value. It approaches company valuation through the Modigliani & Miller model and the OPM model based on input factors such as cost of capital and risk adjustment according to the CAPM model, future profit simulation, debt leverage, corporate income tax, and individual income tax. The course also covers corporate financial management topics such as raising capital through securities issuance, borrowing, leasing, project investment, project appraisal, residual project value, and profit distribution through dividend and retained earnings policies. It combines knowledge of financial statements to discuss the use of financial ratios and stock trading prices, and the beta coefficient.",
