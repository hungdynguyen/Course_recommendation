  "title": "Econometrics II",
  "overview": "This course provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation for explaining empirical evidence: short-term and long-term economic relationships, simultaneous effects of variables, effects of factors on choices, fixed and random effects, components of time series and the nature of a time series. The course consists of two parts: econometric theory and practical experimentation with each type of model using the R software.",
